1. We have created a block

2. Create our Block chain - ie combine the blocks

   - in every chain, there is previosu hash
   - Genesis blcok -

   hash = sum of data + blocknumber + timestamp + previoushash

3. To check the validity

4. PRoof of Work algorithm

   - nonce and calc the part of difficulty is a part of Proof of Work.

5. Difficulty
   - Here we had set the difficulty = 2;

Mining is just calculating the Nonce
